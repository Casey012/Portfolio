                <p>
                    My name is Angelina, I'm a UX Researcher and Designer driven by a passion for crafting intuitive, 
                    accessible, and meaningful user experiences. I specialize in turning complex challenges into 
                    seamless, user-centered solutions by combining thorough research, creative problem-solving, and 
                    empathetic design. Beyond my professional work, I find inspiration in a variety of areas, all of 
                    which shape my approach to design and life.

                <p class="pi">When I‚Äôm not working on a design, I‚Äôm probably in the gym, lifting weights.
                    I spend over <strong>6 hours a week </strong>focusing on strength training, and for me, it‚Äôs a chance to challenge myself, 
                    stay disciplined, and see real
                    progress. Resistance training has taught me a lot about perseverance, setting goals, and pushing
                    past my limits.<br>Currently I am running an upper-lower split by <a href="https://jeffnippard.com/" id="jeff">Jeff Nippard</a> that is 4-5 days per week focusing on hypertrophy and strength.

                <h2 class="h2">My Family üë´</h2>
                <p class="pi">I come from a large extended family, which has been a big part of shaping who I am. Growing up 
                    surrounded by so many people, including my two younger brothers and dogs, taught me the value of connection,
                     collaboration, and supporting one another. Family gatherings are always full of laughter, shared stories, and a 
                     sense of belonging that I cherish deeply. Playing cards and board games together are some of our favorite traditions, bringing 
                     even more fun and connection to our time spent as a family.</p>

            <div id="book">
                <h2 class="h2">Books üìö</h2>
                <p class="pi">I‚Äôm an avid reader who loves escaping into new worlds through books. My favorite genres are romantasy
                     (a perfect mix of romance and fantasy) and the occasional thriller to keep things exciting. 
                     There‚Äôs nothing better than getting lost in a beautifully written story, whether it‚Äôs a magical realm, an epic 
                     love story, or a gripping mystery that keeps me guessing.
                     <br>Some of my favourite books are: </p>
                     <ul id="listb">
                        <li>A Court of Thorns and Roses</li>
                        <li>Throne of Glass</li>
                        <li>Verity</li>
                        <li>One Dark Window</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>I am currently reading Cursed Fates, book 5 of the Zodiac Academy series.</p>

            <div id="tv">
                <h2 class="h2">Shows & Movies üçø</h2>
                <p class="pi">I enjoy TV shows and movies as a way to relax and unwind.
                     From magic and sci-fi to a mix of both, I love how different genres can evoke all kinds of emotions, 
                     from laughter to tears. They provide the perfect escape and often inspire new ideas.
                     <br> My favourites are:
                    </p>
                    <ul id="listb">
                        <li>Harry Potter</li>

                        <li>Firefly Lane</li>
                        <li>How I Met Your Mother</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Right now I am watching Grey's Anatomy.</p>

                <h2 class="h2">Games üéÆ</h2>
                <p class="pi">I enjoy playing cozy video games that help me relax and spark my creativity. Gaming gives me a sense of
                     accomplishment and balance, making it a perfect way to unwind and recharge. It‚Äôs also a way that I connect with family and friends in a fun and exciting way.
