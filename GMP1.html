                <h3 class="h3">Introduction</h3>
                <p>For this project, we designed an accessible pill box aimed at improving medication management for individuals with diverse needs, particularly elderly users who may face memory or motor difficulties. The pill box features automatic pill dispensing and reminder alerts, which help ensure that users take their medication on time and in the correct dosage. Our goal is to create a seamless experience that promotes better medication adherence, ultimately contributing to improved health outcomes. With the growing senior population in society, it is essential to design solutions that enhance their quality of life. To address this, our team focused on transforming the traditional pill box into an automated device. Our first step was to understand the specific challenges seniors encounter in managing their medications.</p>

                <h3 class="h3">Challenges and Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Ensuring accessibility:</b>
                        We must ensure that the device is accessible to individuals with a variety of disabilities, including those with limited vision, hearing impairments, motor limitations, and other challenges.</li>
                    <li><b>Technological difficulties:</b>Many elderly individuals may not be familiar with new technology, so it was essential for us to design a device that is intuitive and easy to use, ensuring that it
                         caters to their comfort and accessibility needs.</li>
                    <li><b>Ergonomics: </b>We also had to consider how the device would integrate into a userâ€™s home environment, taking into account its size, whether it should be portable, and how it would be most convenient
                        for users to interact with it on a daily basis.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We developed the idea of a device that automatically dispenses pills and syncs with an app, allowing users to customize their medication schedule. The device features slots for each day of the week, ensuring proper organization. To further support users, we incorporated a reminder system that uses a weight sensor on the pill plate. This sensor detects whether the pills have been taken and alerts users if they forget to take their medication after a set period of time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="divcontainers">
            <h3 class="h3">Prototyping</h3>
                <p>Our initial prototype was a rough sketch to outline our ideas. From there, we transitioned to creating a physical prototype using cardboard. The primary goal at this stage was to determine the appropriate size and design for the device, as well as to explore how the pills would be inserted. We developed a slider system that allowed us to manually dispense the pills, helping us refine the mechanics of the device.</p>
                      <br>
                <div class="prototype"> 
                <figure class="pfig">
                    <figcaption>Prototype 1</figcaption>
                    <img class="pimg" src="Image/GMP1.1.jpg">
                </figure>
                <figure class="pfig">
                    <figcaption>Prototype 2</figcaption>
                    <img class="pimg" src="Image/GMP1.jpeg">
                </figure>
                </div>
                <p>After prototyping and gathering feedback, we identified some important challenges. One key issue was the difficulty in inserting multiple pills for each day, especially when users had to take different medications at various times. To address this, we redesigned the system so that each slot would hold a different medication. By incorporating weight sensors in each slot, the device could accurately dispense the correct amount of each pill as needed.</p>

                <h3 class="h3">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>As we continued to refine the design, we also began exploring future possibilities for the device. We considered using a high-contrast color scheme to enhance readability, creating an aesthetically pleasing design to encourage users to integrate it into their homes, and incorporating features like braille to improve accessibility for visually impaired individuals. However, due to the constraints of this school assignment, we were unable to conduct comprehensive research or extensive user testing. In an ideal scenario, I would have liked to carry out interviews, usability testing, and A/B testing to fine-tune the design and ensure it fully addresses user needs.</p>
