                <h3 class="h3">Introduction</h3>
                <p>For this project, we have chosen to design an accessible pill box that focuses on better medication management for 
                    users with diverse needs. Our focus is on elderly people who may struggle with memory or motor issues. Our box includes 
                    features like automatically dropping pills and reminders to encourage people to take their medication. We want to enhance 
                    users' experience with taking their medication on time with the proper dosage. By implementing these features, it will
                     result in a more seamless experience for users and ensure that they live a healthier life. In out society were the population has an 
                     increasing amount of seniors, we must design with the intention to help their quality of life. My team decided to tackle the classic
                      pill box and make into an automated device. First, we had to understand the challenges that seniors may face.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="divcontainers">
                <h3 class="h3">Challenges and Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Ensuring accessibility:</b>we must make the device is useable with a variety of disabilities. Including limited vision, 
                        hearing, motor limitations and more.</li>
                    <li><b>Technological difficulties:</b>the elderly may not have a good grasp on new technology, and so we had to ensure that our
                         device was user-friendly and simple to use.</li>
                    <li><b>Ergonomics: </b>we also had to consider how the device would fit into someone’s home, like the size it should be and decided 
                        whether it should be portable.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We then came up with this idea. The device would drop pills automatically and would sync to an app where customizations about time are made. 
                    The pills would be inserted into slots for each day of the week. We also added a reminder system so that the pills wouldn’t be forgotten by
                     adding a weight sensor to the pill plate that would alert users after some time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="divcontainers">
            <h3 class="h3">Prototyping</h3>
                <p>Our first prototype was a rough sketch of ideas. We then moved on to the physical prototype. We made this from cardboard, the main objective was
                     to figure out the sizing, and how the pills would insert into the device. We created a slider system that where we could manually drop the pills.</p>
                      <br>
                <div class="prototype"> 
                <figure class="pfig">
                    <figcaption>Prototype 1</figcaption>
                    <img class="pimg" src="Image/GMP1.1.jpg">
                </figure>
                <figure class="pfig">
                    <figcaption>Prototype 2</figcaption>
                    <img class="pimg" src="Image/GMP1.jpeg">
                </figure>
                </div>
                <p>After prototyping and gathering feedback, we learned some key points. The first was inserting the pills for each 
                    day caused an issue. If the user had to take multiple pills throughout the day the device wouldn’t be able to do
                     that. Instead we changed it that each slot would be a different medication. With weight scales in each slot the
                     device would drop the right amount of each pills.</p>

            <div class="divcontainers">
                <h3 class="h3">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Following this process, we began considering future possibilities for the device. For instance, 
                    selecting a high-contrast color scheme to ensure readability, making the design aesthetically pleasing
                     to encourage users to incorporate it into their homes, and integrating features like braille to
                      enhance accessibility for visually impaired individuals. However, because this was a school assignment,
                       we lacked the time to conduct thorough research and user testing for our prototype. Ideally, I 
                       would have liked to perform interviews, usability testing, and A/B testing to refine the design 
                       and ensure it effectively meets user needs.</p>
