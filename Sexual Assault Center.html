                <h3 class="h3">Research</h3>
                <p>After learning what our objective was, our team started to conduct extensive research. 
                    This included reading multiple books and articles about sexual assault centers, databases, mapping tools, 
                    and more. We also interviewed multiple staff members about their daily experiences and what their work life was life. 
                    Each group member also interviewed their own participants this included an Information Technology Director, two User Experience
                     Designers, and a Delivery Driver. Finally, we
                      learned more about how SACs function, such as the types of computers they operate with and any 
                    constraints they have. With all of this information gathered we had a strong foundation to start our prototyping.</p>

                <h3 class="h3">Challenges and Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Low Budget:</b>The Sexual Assault Center is a non-profit organization, which makes securing funding a significant challenge. They depend heavily on grants and donations to compensate their staff. As a result, the tool we are developing must be cost-effective.</li>
                    <li><b>Staff has Diverse Tech Proficiency: </b>The majority of the SAC staff are volunteers, resulting in a diverse range of ages and skill levels. While some staff members may have limited technological expertise, others may be more proficient. Therefore, the tool we design must be intuitive and user-friendly to ensure accessibility for all staff members.</li>

            <h3 class="h3">Prototyping</h3>
                <p>Our initial prototype was a rough sketch outlining our key ideas, which provided a foundation for user testing and feedback collection. Based on this feedback, we moved forward with our second prototype. Utilizing My Maps, we designed a tool that integrated all our research findings and ideas. The primary feature was the inclusion of multiple layers, representing various services such as police stations, hospitals, sexual assault centers, and more. For each service, we compiled all the essential information requested by the clients, including hours of operation, gender-specific services, contact numbers, addresses, and other relevant details.</p>

                </figure>
                </div>     
                <p>We tested our prototype with various ages ranging from 12 - 60 years old, this way we could ensure our tool 
                    was usable for all ages. We gathered an extensive amount of feedback from our user testing and improved our design further.
                    This resulted in our final prototype, there are two different 
                    versions of this map. Both of these have the same information but are presented in slightly different ways.</p>

                <h3 class="h3">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Reflecting on this project, Iâ€™ve gained valuable insights into the importance of user-centered design and the iterative nature of prototyping. Initially, our first prototype served as a foundational step for gathering user feedback, which helped us refine our ideas and ensure we were heading in the right direction. As we progressed to the second prototype, I learned how crucial it is to integrate research findings into a practical, functional tool that meets the needs of diverse users. One key takeaway was the necessity of considering varying levels of technological literacy, which influenced our design choices, making sure it was accessible to everyone involved. Through this experience, Iâ€™ve developed a deeper understanding of how to balance creativity with practicality, and how to iterate effectively based on feedback to create a solution that is both impactful and user-friendly.</p>
