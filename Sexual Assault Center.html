                <h3 class="h3">Research</h3>
                <p>After learning what our objective was, our team started to conduct extensive research. 
                    This included reading multiple books and articles about sexual assault centers, databases, mapping tools, 
                    and more. We also interviewed multiple staff members about their daily experiences and what their work life was life. 
                    Each group member also interviewed their own participants this included an Information Technology Director, two User Experience
                     Designers, and a Delivery Driver. We also researched multiple approaches to ensure the accuracy and currency of maps. Finally, we
                      learned more about how SACs function, such as the types of computers they operate with and any 
                    constraints they have. With all of this information gathered we had a strong foundation to start our prototyping.</p>

            <div class="divcontainers">
                <h3 class="h3">Challenges and Constraints</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Low Budget:</b> The Sexual Assault Centers is a non-profit organization and so it can be very
                        difficult to find funding. They have to rely on grants and donations to 
                        pay their workers. This means that the tool we are creating must have a low cost.</li>
                    <li><b>Staff has Diverse Tech Proficiency: </b>Many of the SAC staff are volunteers which means there is a variety 
                        of ages and skill sets. Some staff may not be very technologically literate while others are. 
                        So our tool must be easy to and user-friendly so that all staff members are able to use it.</li>
                </ol>

            <div class="divcontainers">
            <h3 class="h3">Prototyping</h3>
                <p>Our first prototype was a rough sketch of our main ideas.
                     This gave us something to test on users and recive feedback from. We then
                      proceded to our second prototype. After deciding to use My Maps we designed a tool that 
                      incorporated all of our research findings and ideas. The main feature was the many layers, which 
                      consisted of different services including Police stations, Hospitals, Sexual Assault Centres, and more. 
                      For each service, we listed all the necessary information that the clients required including hours of operation, 
                      genders, phone number, address, etc. </p>
                      <br>
                <div class="prototype"> 
                <figure class="pfig">

                </figure>
                </div>     
                <p>We tested our prototype with various ages ranging from 12 - 60 years old, this way we could ensure our tool 
                    was usable for all ages. We gathered an extensive amount of feedback from our user testing and improved our design further.
                    This resulted in our final prototype, there are two different 
                    versions of this map. Both of these have the same information but are presented in slightly different ways.</p>

                <p>Our team successfully completed our final prototype which was accessible, cost-effective, 
                    and accurate. We believe that by implementing this tool throughout the Sexual Assault Centres, 
                    the staff will have an easier time navigating and accessing information.</p>
